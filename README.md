# Sfatox-UI

Welcome to the Saftox-UI repository. This library is a custom adaptation of the popular [NextUI](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui) library, re-engineered and optimized for use with SolidJS. It includes a set of UI components designed to facilitate rapid and efficient user interface development for our internal projects.

## Documentation

A complete description of the library, including documentation for all components, will be available later.
